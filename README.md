# Azure Data Factory Workload Template

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Usage](#usage)


## Overview

Use this template to automatically create a Data Factory workspace backed by an Azure DevOps repository

### What's a Template?

A Template is a tool that helps create components inside a Data Mesh. Templates help establish a standard across the organization. This standard leads to easier understanding, management and maintenance of components. Templates provide a predefined structure so that developers don't have to start from scratch each time, which leads to faster development and allows them to focus on other aspects, such as testing and business logic.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p1_user/p6_advanced/p6_1_templates/#getting-started).

#### Skeleton Entities

Introduced in **Witboost 2.3**, Skeleton Entities provide a more dynamic and user-friendly approach to define systems and components. They seamlessly integrate with tools like the Editor Wizard and the Reverse Provisioning Wizard, allowing for easier entity management.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p3_tech/p12_catalog/p12_2_skeleton_entities).

The template uses this new feature. The old version of the template, that generates instead [Legacy Entities](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p3_tech/p12_catalog/p12_2_skeleton_entities/#skeleton-vs-legacy-entities), can be found in this same repository in the branch `release/v1`.

### What's a Workload?

Workload refers to any data processing step (ETL, job, transformation etc.) that is applied to data in a Data Product. Workloads can pull data from sources external to the Data Mesh or from an Output Port of a different Data Product or from Storage Areas inside the same Data Product, and persist it for further processing or serving.

### Data Factory

Azure Data Factory is Azure's cloud ETL service for scale-out serverless data integration and data transformation.

It offers a code-free UI for intuitive authoring and single-pane-of-glass monitoring and management.

Data Factory contains a series of interconnected systems that provide a complete end-to-end platform for data engineers.

Learn more about it on the [official website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/)

## Usage

When importing this template onto your organization for the first time, replace the `input.values.organizationName` field in the `template` step in the `template.yaml` with your Azure DevOps organization name. Do the same on the `input.values.destination` field on the same step in the `template.yaml` by replacing our placeholder "AgileDMBSandbox" in the URL: `dev.azure.com?organization=AgileDMBSandbox&...` with your organization name. 

To get information on how to use this template, refer to this [document](./docs/index.md).

### Component Testing

To verify the component before deploying it along with the Data Product, the component needs to be tested against a CUE Policy defined for [Azure Data Factory](./policies/adf.cue). This policy needs to be defined inside the **Governance** section of the Witboost Platform.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p1_user/p5_managing_policies/p5_1_overview).
